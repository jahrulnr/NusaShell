## [0.0.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- pnpm monorepo scaffold: `apps/` (backend, desktop stubs) and `packages/` (application, infrastructure, transport-ws, contracts, plugin-sdk, shared, testing stubs)
- `packages/domain`: pure domain layer — plugin/tool entities, value objects, lifecycle policies, domain events, errors, and `Result` primitive
- Vitest unit tests for runtime transition matrix and plugin lifecycle rules
- Workspace tooling: `tsconfig.base.json` (strict), `vitest.workspace.ts`, root `typecheck` / `test` scripts

### Notes

- `packages/domain` is the first implemented package; other packages are stubs pending application/infrastructure work.
- PoC under `docs/PoC/` remains the runnable behavioral reference.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Concept-stage product docs: `README.md`, `docs/blueprint.md`, `docs/backend-structure.md`
- Runnable zero-dep bridge PoC under `docs/PoC/` (launcher + Notes plugin + stdio MCP)
- Launcher visual sketch under `docs/ui-design/`
- Agent guidance: root `AGENTS.md`
- Project skill: `.agents/skills/frontend-design/`
- Versioning scaffold: `VERSION`, this changelog, `.github/pull_request_template.md`

### Notes

- No `apps/` or `packages/` monorepo yet - target layout is specified in
  `docs/backend-structure.md` and is the next build milestone.
- Docs language is English throughout.
